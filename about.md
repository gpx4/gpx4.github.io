### Mission 
Be the glue connecting all stakeholders towards finding a treatment for GPX4 related disease. We connect with and advocate for patients with GPX4, drive research, provide funding, influence drug development, clinical trials and treatment. 

### Strategy
At the outset, it might seem impossible for a fledgeling organization to mobilize the complex medical system towards to work on GPX4. We understand and fully acknowledge the difficulty. Instead of inventing new techniques, we use tried and tested techniques from the business world where small companies have disrupted giant enterprises.

* **Open Access**: Through open access to data, models, literature, protocols, and source code, we reduce the barrier to entry for new research or drug developers to enter this market. 
* **Patient Network Effect**: By creating a strong, supportive, and inclusive patient community, we will help researchers and drug developers focus on the solving the technical problems while we liason with the patient community. 
* **MVP (minimal viable product)**: We act more like a business and less like an academic organization. We will identify, fund, and support the smallest valuable step towards treatment and iterate quickly. We will never sacrifice on safety and quality.
